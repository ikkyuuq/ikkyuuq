# Kittipong Prasompong

Just a **Computer Engineering** boi (2022 - **present**) with inspiration in **Software Development, Full Stack Development** and Mobile Application Development, and so on... Currently seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills in a real-world environment. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and building practical solutions to real-world problems.

## Fun Facts

### Currently Learning & Focusing On (Always Learning Until I Think I'm Really Good At It - But I'm Not)
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=flat&logo=rust&logoColor=white) (Fighting with the borrow checker is my cardio)

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-00ADD8?style=flat&logo=go&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)

### Languages That Make Me Question My Life Choices ðŸ¤”

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black) (Somehow they're all falsy)

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) (JavaScript but with more yelling)

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB) (UseEffect is just a fancy way of saying "I hope this works", **HTMX IS JUST BETTER**)


### Development Tools

![Postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-FF6C37?style=flat&logo=postman&logoColor=white)
